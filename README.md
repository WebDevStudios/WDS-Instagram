**Note: Instagram has deprecated much of this API. This widget still works, _if you're showing your own content_. Even then, that functionality will be gone in 2020. It's recommended you look into using the new [Instagram Platform](https://developers.facebook.com/products/instagram/) for API consumption.**

## Instructions

1. Visit https://www.instagram.com/developer/
2. Register a New Instagram Client, and provide https://yourwebsite.com/authorize_instagram as the "Valid Redirect URI".
3. Enter the Client ID and Client Secret into the widget fields.
4. Press the "Connect To Instagram" button to give your site access to your Instagram account.
5. Fill out the widget fields, and press "Save"
